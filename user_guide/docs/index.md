# Castor & Pollux User Guide

[Castor & Pollux](https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-castor-and-pollux) is a Roland Juno-inspired oscillator. It contains two digitally-controlled analog oscillators implemented using a faithfully modernized version of the original Juno 106 design. Like its inspiration, it can give you that wonderful 80s sound with independent and mixed ramp, pulse, and sub outputs. But the twins do not stop there- the second oscillator can be used to layer in thick detuned sounds, harmonically complex hard synced waveshapes, or as a fully independent second oscillator.

Castor & Pollux contains *two* separate oscillators. Each has two inputs with associated knobs:

![Inputs for one oscillator highlighted](images/inputs.png)

- A pitch CV input. The range is 0v to +6v.
- A pitch knob. The range is -1 octave to +1 octave and is added to any incoming pitch CV. These have a special response curve that makes it easier to [tune the oscillators](#tuning).
- A pulse width CV input. This changes the pulse width of the pulse wave. The range is 0v to +5v.
- A pulse width knob. When combined with the pulse width CV it sets the *minimum* pulse width.

Each oscillator also has three dedicated waveshape outputs:

![Outputs for one oscillator highlighted](images/outputs.png)

- A ramp wave output
- A pulse wave output
- A sub square wave output

Each waveshape is nominally 10v peak-to-peak. You can read more about the sound of each waveshape in the [waveshapes](#waveshapes) section.

Each oscillator also has a waveshape mixer that contains level knobs for each waveshape and a mix output:

![Mixer knobs and mixer output highlighted](images/mixer.png)

The [waveshapes](#waveshapes) section also shows how mixing the waveshapes affects the waveshape and sound.

There is also a combined output that mixes the output from both oscillators mixer together. It has a crossfader knob to determine which oscillator is more prominent in the mix:

![Crossfader and combined output](images/crossfader.png)

The [oscillator stacking](#oscillator-stacking) section has more details and sound samples of combining the oscillators together.

Finally, there is a knob to enable chorusing, and a button to enable hard sync:

![Chorusing knob and hard sync button](images/chorusing_hard_sync.png)

The [chorusing](#chorusing) section goes into more detail and has some sound samples. The [hard sync](#hard-sync) section shows how hard sync affects the second oscillator.

Finally, here's a cheatsheet if you'd like to have a quick reference:

## Tuning

Castor & Pollux is an analog oscillator with a digital brain. It's calibrated during assembly to accurately track 1 volt/octave on the *CV inputs* and you can use the *pitch knobs* to adjust the tuning of each oscillator.

In order to make tuning easier, the pitch knobs have a **non-linear** response: they are less sensitive in the middle of their range than the edges. It's usually easier to understand this visually, so try out this little demonstration:

<div class="card interactive">
    <div class="output">
        <label for="linear_tune">Linear response</label>
        <canvas id="linear_tune_canvas" width="640" height="50" class=""></canvas>
        <output id="linear_tune" name="linear_tune">440 Hz</output>
        <label for="non_linear_tune">Non-linear response</label>
        <canvas id="nonlinear_tune_canvas" width="640" height="50" class=""></canvas>
        <output id="non_linear_tune" name="non_linear_tune" class="teal">440 Hz</output>
    </div>
    <form id="tuning-form">
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="tuning_slider" name="tuning_slider"
                    min="-1.0" max="1.0" step="0.001" value="0.0">
            <label for="tuning_slider">pitch knob</label>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>

Notice that with the non-linear response it's much easier to tune to frequencies around `440 Hz`. This is how Castor & Pollux's pitch knobs work. You can configure how strong this effect is using the [settings editor](#editing-module-settings).

The pitch CV inputs can optionally be quantized to the nearest semitone. This is not enabled by default,
but can be enabled using the [settings editor](#editing-module-settings). The pitch knobs are never
quantized, only the CV inputs, so that the knobs can still be used to tune the oscillators.

## Waveshapes

Just like the Juno, Castor & Pollux has three waveshape outputs: ramp, pulse, and sub.

The ramp wave looks like this (click the image to start and stop the animation):

<div class="interactive">
    <canvas id="ramp" width="640" height="480" class="waveform teal"></canvas>
</div>

!!! note "Simulation vs reality"
    These are *simulations* of perfect waveshapes. Castor & Pollux's waveshapes are generated by analog circuitry and they
    don't quite look *exactly* like these examples. That's a good thing - the analog weirdness is what adds character to
    the module.

The ramp sounds like this:

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="ramp wave" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/ramp_octaves.mp3"></audio>
</div>

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="ramp with filter" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/ramp_filtered.mp3"></audio>
</div>

The pulse wave depends on the pulse width CV and knob. You can vary the pulse width in this animation to see how it affects the waveshape:

<div class="interactive">
    <canvas id="pulse" width="640" height="480" class="waveform purple"></canvas>
    <form id="pulse-form">
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="pulse-width" name="width"
                    min="0" max="1.0" step="0.01" value="0.5" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="pulse-width">pulse width</label>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>

You can also configure the [internal low-frequency oscillator](#internal-low-frequency-oscillator) to modulate the pulse width.

Here are some examples of the pulse wave's sounds:

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="pulse wave" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/square_octaves.mp3"></audio>
</div>

<div class="winter-audio-player">

</div>

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="pulse with filter" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/square_filtered.mp3"></audio>
</div>

Finally, there's the sub waveshape. It's a square wave that's one octave lower. Here's what it looks like:

<div class="interactive">
    <canvas id="sub" width="640" height="480" class="waveform red"></canvas>
</div>

And here are some sound samples of the sub waveshape:

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="sub wave" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/sub_octaves.mp3"></audio>
</div>

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="sub with filter" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/sub_filtered.mp3"></audio>
</div>

These waveshapes can be mixed together to produce much more complex and interesting variants - try playing with the sliders under this animation to see how it affects the waveshape:

<div class="interactive">
    <canvas id="mix" width="640" height="480" class="waveform teal2"></canvas>
    <form id="mix-form">
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="ramp_mix" name="ramp_mix"
                    min="0" max="0.5" step="0.01" value="0.5" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="ramp_mix">ramp volume</label>
        </div>
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="pulse_mix" name="pulse_mix"
                    min="0" max="0.5" step="0.01" value="0.25" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="pulse_mix">pulse volume</label>
        </div>
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="pulse_width_mix" name="pulse_width"
                    min="0" max="1.0" step="0.01" value="0.5" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="pulse_width_mix">pulse width</label>
        </div>
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="sub_mix" name="sub_mix"
                    min="0" max="0.5" step="0.01" value="0.25" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="sub_mix">sub volume</label>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>

Here are some sound samples of various mixes:

## Oscillator stacking

Because Castor & Pollux has two oscillators, you can combine them together to build much more complex sounds. When there is no input into the second oscillator's pitch CV jack, it will follow the pitch of the the first oscillator. You can use the pitch knob of the second oscillator to *detune* the second oscillator and cause interesting interactions with the first oscillator. You'll take your output from the **combined output** (marked by the symbol ♊︎) and you can control the relative volume of the two oscillators using the **crossfader** (marked by the symbol Σ).

You can play around with this interactive animation to see how detuning and mixing changes the final waveshape:

<div class="interactive">
    <canvas id="stacked" width="640" height="480" class="waveform purple2"></canvas>
    <form id="stacked-form">
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="stacked_detune" name="detune"
                    min="-1" max="1" step="0.01" value="0.25" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="stacked_detune">detuning</label>
        </div>
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="stacked_mix" name="mix"
                    min="0" max="1.0" step="0.01" value="0.5" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="stacked_mix">crossfader (Σ)</label>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>

This animation just uses the ramp waveshape, but the crossfader takes the mix from each oscillator's mixer, so you can combine many different waveshapes. Here are some sound samples of oscillator stacking:

</div>

## Chorusing

Inspired by the original Juno's analog chorus circuit, Castor & Pollux contains an adaptation of chorusing that works well for a monophonic voice. Instead of applying the chorus affect *after* sound generation, Castor & Pollux's chorusing works by varying the frequency of the second oscillator using an [internal low-frequency oscillator](#internal-low-frequency-oscillator). This means you have to [use both oscillators](#oscillator-stacking) in order to hear this effect. The **chorus knob** (marked by the symbol φ) determines the intensity of chorusing from none when fully counter-clockwise, to its maximum at fully clockwise. The **crossfader** (marked by the symbol Σ) also has an impact on the intensity of the chorus. Finally, you can modify the speed of the chorus by changing the [internal low-frequency oscillator's frequency](#internal-low-frequency-oscillator).

You can play around with this interactive animation to see how the chorusing amount changes the final waveshape. You'll need to click on the animation to start it otherwise you won't really be able to see the chorusing effect.

<div class="interactive">
    <canvas id="chorusing_" width="640" height="480" class="waveform red2"></canvas>
    <form id="chorusing-form">
        <div class="slider">
            <input type="range" id="chorusing_amount" name="amount"
                    min="0" max="1" step="0.01" value="0.25" data-bind data-bind-type="float">
            <label for="chorusing_amount">chorusing amount (φ)</label>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>

Here are some sound samples of chorusing:

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="chorusing" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/chorusing.mp3"></audio>
</div>

## Hard sync

[*Hard sync*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillator_sync) is a feature seen in several synthesizer voices that have two or more oscillators. However, it's not a feature seen on the original Juno because each voice only had one oscillator. Since Castor & Pollux has two oscillators to work with, it has an adaption of hard sync. Hard sync allows you to sync the second oscillator to the first - the output will retain the same *base frequency* as the first oscillator but the waveshape will be impacted by the frequency of the second oscillator. In other words, it'll sound like the same note but have a much different timbre.

To use hard sync **tap** the hard sync button - the LEDs should all change to the same color. You'll use the first oscillator's pitch CV to set the note and you'll use the second oscillator's pitch knob or pitch CV input to control the timbre. You'll take the output from the second oscillator (or the combined output) - since hard sync does not impact the waveshape of the first oscillator.

Here are some sound samples of hard sync:

<div class="winter-audio-player">
    <audio title="hard sync" controls crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/files.winterbloom.com/gemini/hard_sync.mp3"></audio>
</div>

!!! note "Heads up"
    Due to the way hard sync works, you shouldn't set the second oscillator to a *lower* frequency than the first. It'll just result in the sound growing softer since the second oscillator doesn't have enough time to output a complete wave cycle.


## Internal low-frequency oscillator

Castor & Pollux has an built-in low-frequency oscillator (*LFO*) that's used for modulation. This LFO drives the [chorus](#chorusing) feature, but can also be assigned to some other parameters.

To configure the internal LFO, **hold** down the hard sync button. The module's lights should change. While holding the hard sync button you can modify the following settings:

![LFO configuration knobs highlighted](images/tweak.png)

1. Moving the **chorus knob** (φ) will change the frequency of the LFO. The LEDs at the bottom of the module will pulse to show the LFO's frequency.
2. Moving the **pulse width** knob of each of the oscillators will enable or disable LFO routing to the oscillator's pulse width. When the LFO is routed to an oscillator, its pulse width knob will control the *intensity* of the pulse width modulation instead of directly setting the pulse width. Turning the knob counter-clockwise will disable the LFO routing, turning it clockwise will enable it. The LEDs near the oscillator will illuminate if the LFO routing is enabled.

By default, the internal LFO is a straightforward triangle wave. However, the [settings editor](#editing-module-settings) allows you to change the LFO's waveshape between triangle, sine, sawtooth, and square, as well as combine a *second* waveshape with the first to create interesting LFO effects.


## Editing module settings

Even though Castor & Pollux uses analog circuitry to make its beautiful sounds, there is a little microcontroller brain inside that's orchestrating everything. There are a few settings you can tweak over USB, such as the LED brightness, and the range of the pitch knobs. Head over to the [web-based settings editor](settings) to tweak to your heart's content.

## Updating the firmware

1. Download the latest firmware [from GitHub](https://github.com/wntrblm/Castor_and_Pollux/releases/latest). It will be a `.uf2` file.
1. Connect Castor & Pollux to your computer via USB. The USB port is located underneath the panel. Note that you still have to power the module from a Eurorack power supply.
1. Place Castor & Pollux in bootloader mode by quickly pressing the reset button twice. The reset button is located just below the USB port. Once in bootloader mode, you should see a drive on your computer named `GEMINIBOOT`.
1. Copy the `.uf2` file from step 1 to the `GEMINIBOOT` drive. The module should restart by itself.

## Warranty, disclaimers, and limits

Modules purchased from Winterbloom have a warranty of six months from the date of purchase. This warranty covers any manufacturing defects in the module. It does not cover damage due to incorrect handling, storage, power, overvoltage events, or modifications.

Please [contact us](mailto:support@winterbloom.com) if you are experiencing issues with your module. Modules returned under warranty will either be refunded, replaced, or repaired at our discretion. You will be responsible for the cost of returning the module to Winterbloom.

Because Eurorack has a vast number of possible combinations of power supplies, modules, cases, and accessories, it is impossible for us to guarantee compatibility with every possible configuration. We make a reasonable effort to test modules with several power supplies, cases, and other modules.

We encourage tinkering, however, we will not refund, repair, or replace any products that have been modified.

We have stress tested Castor & Pollux under the following conditions. These are provided for reference only; we do not guarentee that that the module will function under these conditions.

* Continuous run time: at least 48 hours
* Overvoltage from power supply: at least `±18 volts`
* Reverse voltage from power supply: at least `±18 volts`
* Undervoltage from power supply: as low as `±10 volts`
* Over and under voltage on inputs: at least `±8 volts`
* Output connected to another output: at least `±8 volts`
* Output shorted to ground: at least 60 minutes


## Acknowledgments and thanks

Castor & Pollux would not be possible without the help of the Adafruit, support from Microchip, and the volumes of literature documenting and analyzing the Juno's DCO design.
